## CIS3301-Temperature-Conversion

## Instructions

In this assignment, we are going to do a program that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin. The program must ask for the temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it to the unit indicated by the user. You must use the prompts listed below.

You are instructed to do all the code in the main function. As an extra challenge, you can break your code into different functions. Later in the semester, we will use this program to learn how to use functions.

## Use the following conversion formulas

* Fahrenheit to Celsius: (temperature - 32) x .5556
* Celsius to Kelvin: temperature_in_celcius + 273.15

## Use the following user prompts

* Welcome the user
  * **"\nWelcome to the temperature conversion program"**
* Request the user the temperature in Fahrenheit
  * **"Please enter the temperature in F you want to convert: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Display menu for conversion
  * **"Please select the unit of temperature you want to convert to"**
  * **"1) Celsius"**
  * **"2) Kelvin"**
* Request the user their option from the menu
  * **"\nPlease enter your option: "** (note the space after the colon)
* Return the user to the temperature converted to the desired scale
  * For Celsius, use the following message
    * **"x in Fahrenheit is y in Celsius"** (replace x and y with the appropriate values)
  * For Kelvin, use the following message
    * **"x in Fahrenheit is y in Kelvin"** (replace x and y with the appropriate values)
